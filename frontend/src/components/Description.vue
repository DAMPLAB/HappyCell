Your genetic design helper.
Our goal is to help researchers to simplify their plasmid design work.

You can visualize plasmid and genetic circuit; error checking the genetic design assembly…


HappyCell have three modules:
Design analysis
In this section we visualize plasmid and genetic circuit.
The circuit statistics related to score and assembly is showed at bottom.

Assembly logistics

This section will provide the error checking of the assembly, material (enzyme) list, safety warnings to prevent accidents…



Build
This section shows the pathway of building your DNA design.

Integration point between Cello and Puppeteer.

Easy “click” to build & monitoring




Features:

- Built-in database: commonly used commercial plasmids map, and information including, vendor information, restriction sites, and annotation...

- SBOL Representation of Circuit

- Simple click and drop files (Fasta file/SBOL file)
